# DangCatFeeder
Dang Family Automated Cat Feeder, spins servo motor / send and recieves emails

Credited functions to storiknow.com / Sam Storino!

I started this project to solve a problem, he was gaining too much weight.
We fed him too much, so I suggested we try to feed him in smaller doses at
more time periods. That failed because of our lack of consistency. 

Voila!

This spawned the idea of an automated cat feeder. I finished the project after
2 months and decided to make my own revisions! I added in some functions that
would use an email system as a means of a 'subject line function call' for 
the actual code. Now the RaspberryPi Module 3 will tell you with a timestamp
when the cats were specifically fed.

Thanks for viewing my project!
